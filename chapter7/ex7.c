/*
 * chapter 7, exercise 7
 * Prime numbers can also be generated by an algorithm known as the Sieve of
 * Erastosthenes.The algorithm for this procedure is presented here.Write a program
 * that implements this algorithm. Have the program find all prime numbers up to n
 * = 150.What can you say about this algorithm as compared to the ones used in the
 * text for calculating prime numbers?
 * Sieve of Erastosthenes Algorithm
 * To Display All Prime Numbers Between 1 and n
 * Step 1: Define an array of integers P. Set all elements Pi to 0, 2 <= i <= n.
 * Step 2: Set i to 2.
 * Step 3: If i > n, the algorithm terminates.
 * Step 4: If Pi is 0, then i is prime.
 * Step 5: For all positive integer values of j, such that i x j â‰¤ n, set Pixj to 1.
 * Step 6: Add 1 to i and go to step 3.
